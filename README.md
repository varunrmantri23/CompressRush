# CompressRush

## Why Another Compression Tool?

Because why not? Existing tools are cool, but I want something that'll make me understand compression deeper than just "zip goes brrr".

## Project Goals

-   [ ] Implement at least 3 compression algorithms
-   [ ] Make it faster than existing tools (challenge accepted!)
-   [ ] Learn some crazy C++ magic
-   [ ] Potentially impress someone at a job interview

## Challenges I'm Expecting

-   Memory management nightmares
-   Performance optimization black magic
-   Debugging bit-level operations
-   Not losing my sanity

## Tech Stack

-   C++20 ig
-   CMake (build system)
-   Google Benchmark
-   TBB for parallel processing

## Weekly Rough Plan

-   Week 1-2: Research & Basic Implementations
-   Week 3-4: Optimization & Performance
-   Week 5: CLI & Usability
-   Week 6: Polish & Showcase

## Potential Stretch Goals

-   Machine learning algorithm selector
-   Performance visualization
-   Cross-platform support

## Resources I'll Probably Use

-   CppCon talks
-   Stack Overflow (let's be real)
-   Random compression algorithm papers
-   Lots of coffee ‚òï

## Progress Tracking

-   [ ] Huffman Coding
-   [ ] LZW Algorithm
-   [ ] Performance Benchmarks
-   [ ] CLI Interface

Wish me luck! üçÄ
